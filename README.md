# Add Custom Actions to Mautic Campaign Builder
Recently while working for a client I developed a Mautic plugin to add custom action on Campagin builder.



<!--<strong style="display:none;">Features:</strong>
<ul><li><strong>Camera button</strong>: tap to capture image. Hold to record video of max limit 10 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Flash control button</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Camera switch button:</strong> to switch between front and back cameras.</li>
<li><strong>Stickers:</strong> you can add stickers to your photos and videos. Place stickers anywhere on camera preview and adjust their sizes accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Add Text:</strong> similar to stickers, you can also add text to images and videos and change its font colour.</li>
<li><strong>Save media:</strong> you can also save images and videos to your device.</li>
<li><strong>Upload:</strong> there is a button to upload images to web. However server side programming needs to be done.</li>
</ul>-->

<p>Your actions will show up in campagin bulder. You can also create new conditions or decisions which gives you complete control over your customer's journy.</p>

<p>And when the action is triggered, it will show in your customer's profile activity.</p>
